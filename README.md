# CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer-Refactorization
## Symbolic Music Genre Transfer with CycleGAN - Refactorization

Since the project - CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer was published, quite a lot people were interested in it. However due to my poor coding skills and lacking of eperiences, there were some annoying problems like following which confused people a lot: 
- Code is not very readable. 
- Code structure is bad. 
- Comments are not enough. 
- Data preprocessing part is not easy to use. 
- Module import problem. 
And there were also some requests like:
- Provide the pretrained model. 
- Provide the dataset which could be fed into the model directly. 
- Network improvement, such as introducing WGAN or WGAN-GP.
- Extend Single track to Multiple tracks

I'm quite busy with my study and other stuff, here sorry for my irresponsiveness to these problems and requests previously. Thus, I want to refactor the previous project in high-level APIs such as TensorFlow 2.0 with Keras, Pytorch and MXNet with Gluon, which makes it easy for you to read and play. In this repository, I mainly focus on improving the code quality. 

Still, I cannot guarantee the codes make everyone happy and reproduce the same output with original one. I'll try my best to improve my own skills and I'm happy to communicate with you guys. Feel free to raise issues or pull requests with comments. LIVE AND LEARN!
